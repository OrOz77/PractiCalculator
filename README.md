Android App for Common Calculations

The purpose of this app is to make an all-in-one program for daily calculations and unit conversions. 
The app will feature numerous calculators with ease of use in mind. This is intended for those who prefer
convenience over manually performing operations on a calculator. Since many variations of this idea exist on the 
Play Store, I am putting the app's design on the forefront. Every calculation will be quick, easy to change, and set up
with minimal confusion.

Upon launch, the calculators provided are:

Tip, Sale, GPA, Binary, and BMI.

The first big update will include a unit conversion system with many options to choose from.
